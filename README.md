# Teaching maths using Lean and controlled natural language

This is a supporting project for the workshop
[Interactive Theorem Proving in Education and Research](https://exlean.org/workshop-interactive-theorem-proving-in-education-and-research-july-2024/)
in Exeter on July 24th 2024.

This is a demo of the [Verbose Lean](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/verbose-lean4) library. You can read a 
[paper about it](verbose_paper.pdf) written for ITPâ€¯2024.

If you are interested in teaching elementary undergrad math using Lean,
you should also check out 
[The mechanics of proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/) by Heather
Macbeth, as well as the 
[Lean community teaching resources](https://leanprover-community.github.io/teaching/index.html).

If you would rather use Coq, see [waterproof](https://impermeable.github.io/).
