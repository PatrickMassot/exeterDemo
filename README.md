# Teaching maths using Lean and controlled natural language

This is a supporting project for my talk at the workshop
[Interactive Theorem Proving in Education and Research](https://exlean.org/workshop-interactive-theorem-proving-in-education-and-research-july-2024/)
in Exeter on July 24th 2024. I am Patrick Massot from 
[Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr) in
Orsay, but a lot of the work presented here happened during a year I just spent
in the [Hoskinson Center](https://www.cmu.edu/hoskinson/) for formal mathematics at 
[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in Pittsburgh.

This is a demo of the [Verbose Lean](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/verbose-lean4) library. You can read a 
[paper about it](verbose_paper.pdf) written for ITPâ€¯2024.

If you are interested in teaching elementary undergrad math using Lean,
you should also check out 
[The mechanics of proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/) by Heather
Macbeth, as well as the 
[Lean community teaching resources](https://leanprover-community.github.io/teaching/index.html).

If you would rather use Coq, see [waterproof](https://impermeable.github.io/).

If you want to try this demo without installing Lean then you can

[![Open the project in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/patrickmassot/exeterDemo) 

and use the file explorer to open the file `ExeterDemo/Demo.lean`.
